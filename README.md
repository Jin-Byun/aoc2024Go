# This is a repo for Advent of Code 2024 response

## day 1 omitted cause I am making this on day 2.

## All has been solved (Jan 10th, 2025), but some I don't quite understand (got hint from the reddit posts)

# To Do (before December of 2025):

[ ] Check on day16 to see why it didn't work with A\* implementation
[ ] Check of day 24 (bit adder problem) to fully understand the steps
[ ] Check of day 21 (sequence of robot input) to fully understand the steps
[ ] Refactor
